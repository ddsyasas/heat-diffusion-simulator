# Heat Diffusion Simulator

A Python project for simulating heat diffusion in 1D materials.

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement a numerical simulation of heat diffusion using the heat equation:

```
∂T/∂t = α * ∂²T/∂x²
```

where:
- T is temperature
- t is time
- x is position  
- α is thermal diffusivity
